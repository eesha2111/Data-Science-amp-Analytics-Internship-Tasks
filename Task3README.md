## Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

### Objective
To identify bank customers who are likely to leave the bank using machine learning classification techniques.

### Dataset
Churn Modelling dataset containing customer demographic information, account details, and churn status.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Approach
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preparation
3. Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding)
4. Feature scaling
5. Classification modeling using Logistic Regression
6. Feature importance analysis using Random Forest
7. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

### Results
- Achieved good classification accuracy
- Identified key factors influencing customer churn
- Feature importance provided meaningful business insights

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end customer churn prediction pipeline, highlighting the role of data preprocessing, supervised learning, and feature interpretation in predictive analytics.
