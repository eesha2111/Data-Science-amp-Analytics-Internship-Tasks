## Task1: Exploring and Visulaizing a Simple Dataset

### Objective
To explore, visualize, and understand the Iris dataset using Python, and to build a simple machine learning model for classification.

### Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with four numerical features and three flower species.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Approach
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Perform basic data summarization
3. Visualize relationships, distributions, and outliers
4. Train a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

### Results
- High classification accuracy (~97%)
- Clear class separation using petal features
- Minimal misclassification

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates fundamental data exploration, visualization, and machine learning skills using a simple and well-known dataset.
